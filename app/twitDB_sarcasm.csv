Honduras - now they know how to play football the right way. Class team with plenty of skill #sarcasm #terrible Oh but Benzema is class
Tied 2-2, need a pitcher who can throw strikes and get you to extras, Francona calls for Axford. Seems logical #sarcasm
Well Honduras is representing the CONCACAF well #sarcasm
thing is Irvine has good experience of lower divisions so some great signings coming up??  #sarcasm

@ConnorKiesel ha ha oh I know. You need to add a #sarcasm or people will think your with them!
Great night for Heat fans..
#sarcasm
Clearly it's LeBron's fault the Heat lost guys.  Averaging 28.2 PPG in the Finals is simply terrible #sarcasm
Well done @espn for showing Lebrons walk to the locker room. #sarcasm You guys suck! Show the champs! #spurs
LeBron is such a loser, 2 titles in 4 years, all four years trips to the finals. #sarcasm

Looks like the spurs are gonna go ahead and shut down the heat. I feel so bad for #lebron #sarcasm
Oh no....the heat are letting it all slip away! #sarcasm Bwahahahahahahahaha!

Tied 2-2, need a pitcher who can throw strikes and get you to extras, Francona calls for Axford. Seems logical #sarcasm
Well Honduras is representing the CONCACAF well #sarcasm
