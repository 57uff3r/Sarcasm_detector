People stay sucking the Heat. Who cares they've made it to the finals the last 4 years. How many times has your team ?
Lebron played a wonderful game. \n\nThat's just it.  \n\nHe said in the interview their intensity was bad from Game 1. \ud83d\ude11
Shows how using championship on a player's individual greatness is irrelevant since it's a team effort.
And came into today averaging 27.5 points per game, with a 119 o-rating. Maybe just give the Spurs credit instead forcing a fake narrative
